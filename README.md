# work-day-planner

The user is presented with a time block for each hour of the typical workday (9 a.m. to 6 p.m.), which turn green if the hour is in the future, red if it is the current hour, and grey if it is in the past. They can type notes or tasks to be completed into the appropriate hour block, and when they press the "save" button, their input is saved to that hour block so they can continue to view it until they delete it.
